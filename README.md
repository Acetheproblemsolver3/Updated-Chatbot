# Updated Chatbot
This repository contains the updated version of my dynamic chatbot project, built using Streamlit. This project is an extension of my previous dynamic chatbot project, with a new and improved interface powered by Streamlit.

What's New?
-Streamlit Integration: This updated version of the chatbot uses Streamlit to provide a more interactive and user-friendly interface.
-Enhanced User Experience: The new interface allows for a more conversational experience, with real-time responses and a more dynamic interaction with the AI model.
-Improved Performance: The updated chatbot takes advantage of Streamlit's performance optimizations, making it faster and more responsive.

About the Project
This dynamic chatbot project uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to generate human-like responses to user input. The chatbot is trained on a large dataset of conversations and can adapt to different topics and contexts.

Features:
-Conversational Interface: Engage with the chatbot in a natural, conversational way.
-Real-time Responses: Get instant responses to your questions and inputs.
-Dynamic Topics: Explore different topics and contexts with the chatbot.
-AI-powered: Powered by machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques.

Getting Started
-To run the chatbot, simply clone this repository and run the app.py file using Streamlit. Follow the instructions in the README file of Dynamic AI's repo for more information.
